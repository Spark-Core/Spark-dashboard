This software is only used for internal development, which means we do not give out any support / documentation with this product, at this time. If shown that people would like to have this, we could reconsider this at a later date.

It's mainly public because we want people to see what their bot using Spark does with the data it sends to Spark servers.
If you want, you could modify the code and use it to monitor the data coming in from your bots using Spark.


###### Things you are allowed to do:

- Clone the software to experiment with how we handle our incoming traffic
- Make improvements & share them here.
- Managing your own bots incoming data.
- Host your own version for private use.

###### Things you are not allowed to do:
- Claim your hosted version is official.
- Host for public use and promote other users to switch their settings to use your host.
- Force other users to switch the auth url defaulted in the Spark framework to your host.
- Provide documentation.
- Trying to find loopholes, bugs, errors, etc. in the software without reporting them [here](https://github.com/sparkbots/Spark-auth/issues).
